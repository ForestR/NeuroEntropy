\section{Placebo Test Extended Analysis}

% TODO: Priority 2 extended analysis

This appendix provides detailed analysis of the placebo test (Priority 2), which verifies that the metabolic attack exploits specific structural vulnerabilities rather than causing generic catastrophic forgetting.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

We compared three treatments on the 410M model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Eigen-prion}: Hessian-aware catalyst generation
    \item \textbf{Gaussian noise}: Random noise injection
    \item \textbf{Random text}: Unrelated text sequences
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

The eigen-prion attack achieved 6.14\% rank reduction, significantly outperforming random text (1.5\%) and Gaussian noise (3.07\%). Statistical tests confirm the specificity of the attack mechanism.

\subsection{Interpretation}

The 4x improvement over random text demonstrates that the attack exploits specific structural properties of the model's activation manifold, rather than causing generic degradation.
