\section{Theoretical Framework}

% TODO: The math we derived (Adam Amplification + Norm Coupling)

This section presents the mathematical foundations of metabolic attacks and spectral collapse.

\subsection{Low-Rank Hypothesis}

We assume that language models operate in a low-dimensional effective manifold. The effective rank $\effrank(\model)$ captures the dimensionality of the model's functional space.

\subsection{Adam Amplification Mechanism}

The Adam optimizer maintains second-moment estimates that amplify gradients in directions corresponding to small Hessian eigenvalues. This amplification can be exploited to induce progressive degradation.

% TODO: Include formal derivation of Adam amplification in null space directions
% Key equation: How Adam amplifies noise in directions with small eigenvalues

\subsection{Norm Coupling}

The coupling between gradient norms and spectral structure creates a feedback loop: attacks in null space directions reduce effective rank, which in turn increases vulnerability to further attacks.

% TODO: Mathematical formulation of norm coupling

\subsection{Metabolic Attack Formulation}

A metabolic attack $\catalyst$ is crafted to maximize noise amplification in null space directions, exploiting the Adam amplification mechanism to induce spectral collapse.
