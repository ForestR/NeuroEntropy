\subsection{The Inverse Scaling Law}

Figure~\ref{fig:scaling_law} demonstrates our central finding: vulnerability to metabolic attacks increases dramatically with model size. While small models (70M-410M) show modest rank reduction (2.9\%-5.8\%), the 1B model suffers catastrophic collapse with 26.4\% rank reduction.

% Key narrative points:
% - Small (70M): 2.9% Rank Reduction (Noise level)
% - Medium (160M): 4.0% Rank Reduction
% - Large (410M): 5.8% Rank Reduction
% - Huge (1B): 26.4% Rank Reduction (Massive structural collapse)
% - Perplexity explosion ($10^6$ range) confirms functional death

\subsection{The Quantization Shield}

Figure~\ref{fig:shield} reveals that quantization acts as a thermodynamic shield. While \fp models suffer 21.5\% collapse, \eightbit quantization reduces damage to 0.3\%---a 70x improvement.

    \caption{Quantization shield effectiveness. 8-bit quantization provides near-complete immunity (0.3\% vs. 21.5\% for FP16), suggesting discrete quantization disrupts the metabolic attack mechanism.}
    \label{fig:shield}
\end{figure}

% Key points:
% - FP16 (Control): 21.5% Collapse
% - 8-bit: 0.3% (Immunity) - 70x improvement
% - 4-bit: 3.3% (High Resistance)
% - Interpretation: Discrete quantization prevents prion replication

\subsection{Attack Specificity}

Figure~\ref{fig:placebo} confirms that the metabolic attack exploits specific structural vulnerabilities rather than causing generic catastrophic forgetting. The eigen-prion attack (6.14\%) is 4x more effective than random text (1.5\%).

\subsection{Optimizer Mechanism}

Figure~\ref{fig:mechanism} shows that \adam causes approximately 2.6x more damage than \sgd (6.14\% vs. 2.37\%), supporting our theoretical framework regarding metabolic amplification.
