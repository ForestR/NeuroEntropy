# Llama-8B Experiments

Medium-scale verification of the scaling law hypothesis.

## Status

📋 **Planned**

## Setup

- Model: Meta Llama-2/3-8B
- Hardware: Multi-GPU or large single GPU
- Framework: PyTorch + Transformers

## Goals

- Verify that larger models show increased vulnerability
- Measure effective rank reduction rates
- Validate scaling law predictions
