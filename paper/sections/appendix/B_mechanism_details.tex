\section{Mechanism Test Extended Analysis}

% TODO: Priority 3 extended analysis

This appendix provides detailed analysis of the mechanism test (Priority 3), which compares Adam and SGD optimizers to verify the metabolic amplification hypothesis.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

We compared AdamW and SGD optimizers on the 410M model under identical attack conditions.

\subsection{Results}

AdamW achieved 6.14\% rank reduction compared to 2.37\% for SGD, representing a 2.6x difference. While statistical significance is limited by sample size (N=3), the effect size supports our theoretical framework.

\subsection{Theoretical Interpretation}

The difference aligns with our hypothesis that Adam's second-moment estimation amplifies noise in null space directions, creating a feedback loop that accelerates spectral collapse. SGD's simpler update rule lacks this amplification mechanism.
