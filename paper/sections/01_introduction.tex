% TODO: The "Energy vs. Structure" duality

Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities through scaling, yet their internal structure remains poorly understood. This work explores a fundamental tension in modern AI systems: the relationship between \textit{energy} (optimization dynamics) and \textit{structure} (manifold geometry).

% Key themes:
% - Energy vs Structure duality
% - Scaling laws and model fragility
% - The need for understanding structural robustness

\subsection{The Fragility of Giants}

As models scale, they become more capable but potentially more fragile. We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of spectral collapse---the progressive degradation of a model's effective rank under adversarial conditions.

\subsection{Contributions}

Our main contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A theoretical framework linking Adam optimization dynamics to spectral collapse
    \item Empirical demonstration of an inverse scaling law: larger models are more vulnerable
    \item Discovery that quantization provides a natural defense mechanism
    \item Analysis of attack specificity through placebo and mechanism tests
\end{enumerate}
