# Scaling Law Experiments

Community-contributed experiments on large models (70B+).

## Status

🔍 **Seeking Collaborators**

## Help Wanted

We need help verifying our scaling law predictions on large models. If you have access to:
- Llama-3-70B
- GPT-3.5/4 (via API)
- Other large models (70B+)

Please see our [Help Wanted issue](https://github.com/ForestR/NeuroEntropy/issues/1) for detailed experimental protocols.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Follow the experimental protocol in the issue
2. Document your hardware setup
3. Share results (rank reduction metrics, visualizations)
4. Include a brief analysis

Your contributions will be credited in publications and documentation!
